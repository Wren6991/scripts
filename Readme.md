Scripts
=======

A repository of "useful" scripts, most of them hacked together and few of them working.

- ebay_login.py
	- logs into ebay, runs a search for buy it now items less than £1 with some dubious keywords, and buys a random item. I run this once a week.
- sfe_login.py
	- logs into SFE's website and checks the correspondence page to see if they've sent me any new post or emails. Emails me if they have (sshhh it's useful)
